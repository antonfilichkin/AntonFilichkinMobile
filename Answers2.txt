Q - Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device in mobile cloud.
    Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
A - Hardcode new url containing token to property. Successful run.

Q - Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device in mobile cloud.
    Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices
    (reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities).
    Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server of EPAM mobile cloud it’s mandatory.
    Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
A - No.

Q - Try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before instead of appPackage and appActivity. Does this approach work?
A - No, btw it is true by default (by Appium documentation).

Q - What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
A - As written on EPAM Mobile Cloud site:
    "Because your Appium tests and Mobile Cloud are distributed, Desired Capability "app" is ignored at this moment."
     and "before running Appium test, please install application under test using REST API and then ..."
     Our code does not handle installation of app via EPAM Mobile Cloud REST API.
     To fix it, we need to study info on Mobile Farm REST API, and implement installation of app via Mobile Farm REST API.
     Or wait for "In future releases we are going to support "app" Desired Capability". )))
