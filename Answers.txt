Q5 - Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
A - You should change "deviceName" capability from emulator name to real device name.
 capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "emulator-5554") =>
 capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "13710040515") in my case.

Q6 - Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
    Are there any difference with run on emulator?
A - Real device is at least 4 secs slower when running Contact Manager pageObjects.app tests (21-41 sec) vs 17-21 sec on virtual one.
